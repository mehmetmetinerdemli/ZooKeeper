<h2>Text blocks with ending quotes</h2>
<p></p>
<p>You have a text block that ends with a quotation mark, but you also want your string to end with the quote and not have a new line character inserted at the end. As it stands, the code below won't compile. Fix the final group of quotation marks so that the code will compile and the text of the String ends with a quotation mark. Enter just the characters after the ! character in the text box below.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If all characters AFTER the '!' character were removed, what would you need to do to solve this problem?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String poem = """

              Over park, over pale,
              Thorough flood, thorough fire!""""</code></pre>
